1. ABSTRACT 
This project is a menu-driven Restaurant Order Management System developed in C programming language. 
It allows the user to add customer orders with table number, item name, quantity, and price. 
The system supports displaying all orders, generating bills for individual tables, and deleting orders.
The program demonstrates usage of structures, arrays, functions, and basic input/output operations 
to provide a simple, efficient solution for managing restaurant orders. 

------------------------------------------------------------

2. OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to implement a functional Restaurant Order Management System 
using fundamental C programming concepts. This includes:
- Using structures to model order details.
- Applying arrays for managing multiple orders.
- Implementing functions for modular design.
- Using console input/output for user interaction.
- Enabling basic operations like add, display, bill generation, and deletion of orders.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Managing orders manually in a restaurant can be confusing and prone to errors.
This project aims to create a simple computer program to record and track customer orders,
make billing easy and accurate, and reduce management overhead.
This system ensures efficient handling of multiple orders across different tables with clear visibility.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ALGORITHM

System Design:
- The program uses a structure named 'Order' to store individual order information.
- A fixed-size array holds all current orders (up to 100).
- Menu-driven interface allows the user to perform various operations.

Algorithm Highlights:

Add Order:
1. Check if maximum order count (100) reached.
2. Take input: table number, item name, quantity, price.
3. Store input as a new order in the array.
4. Increment order count.

Display Orders:
1. If no orders, display "No orders".
2. Loop through orders array and display each order’s details and price total.

Generate Bill:
1. Ask for table number.
2. Loop through orders to find matching table.
3. Calculate and display total cost for that table.

Delete Orders:
1. Ask for table number to delete.
2. Shift array elements to remove orders for given table.
3. Adjust order count.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Key features and code components used in this project:

1. Structure declaration with fixed-size character array for item names.
2. Functions: addOrder(), displayOrders(), generateBill(), and deleteOrders() for modularity.
3. User input handled via scanf, output via printf.
4. Boundary checks to prevent overflows. 

6. TESTING AND RESULTS

1. Tested adding multiple orders for several tables.
2. Verified correct display of orders and calculated totals.
3. Confirmed bill generation accuracy per table.
4. Successfully deleted orders and updated order count.
5. Program handled edge cases, including empty lists and max capacity.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The project demonstrates how to manage and bill restaurant orders using basic C programming. It is user-friendly, reliable, and scalable to limited order volumes. Future improvements include persistent file storage, GUI interface, and multi-user support.
